# ForgottenDelivery
*Huh, looks like someone left a delivery package behind. Oh well, you know what they say, one man's trash is a robot's treasure!*

This mod adds the chance for delivery packages to spawn on each level. These packages do not have any value, but inside is a free shop item. To get the item, you just have to break open the package. Sometimes a big package spawns instead, which has more expensive items. What each package can drop is listed below:

> ## Regular Package Items
> - Drones
> - Orbs
> - Upgrades
> - Power Crystals
> - Grenades
> - Health Packs
> - Mines

> ## Big Package Items
> - C.A.R.T.s
> - Pocket C.A.R.T.s
> - Melees
> - Guns
> - Trackers

**Note that by default most items received from these packages are temporary and will disappear after leaving the level.** Items like the energy crystals and upgrades will be permanent once used.

By default a single package has a 50% chance to spawn each level, and a 25% chance to be big. These settings can be changed in the config file. Below are the names of the item types the config file will use for drops:

> drone, orb, cart, upgrade, crystal, grenade, melee, healthpack, gun, tracker, mine, pocketcart

To install the mod manually (outside Thunderstore) put the "forgottendelivery" and "ForgottenDelivery.dll" file inside a folder called ForgottenDelivery (or whatever you want to name it) under the BepInEx/plugins directory.
